If you would like to contribute to this project first have a look a at the current issues, projects and miles stones. 
They will have will grenerrally outline where we are heading with our own goals for development.
If you have something new in mind just open up a new issue and we can can have a chat on how best to go about implementing those things.

But in general we would like to encourage you to fork the project and do the development in a separate branch 
and when you feel the code is at a stage where it can be merged back in to the main project open up a pull request. And we will review the changes.

Please keep the changes per pull request to a maganeble size so other can read through them an understand what changed.

*This guild will probably over time become more detailed as we aim to set up a pipeline and infrastructure for automated builds and tests.*
